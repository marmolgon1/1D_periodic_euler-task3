# 1D periodic Euler
An Finite Volume implementation of the 1D Euler equations

The purpose of this repo is to have a Finite Volume implementation of the Euler equations for educational purposes. 

The domain will be a periodic line for simplicity. Although the domain is structured, it will be dealt with as if it was unstructured just to illustrate the additional memory accesses incurred by this.
